## Morea Reference Guide

This module introduces you to the design of modules and their implementation using the Morea Framework. 

During the module, we teach you "just enough" about Morea to give you a sense for the development process. 

However, once you start working on a real module (as opposed to a fake module like Best Recipe Ever), you will need to acquire a few more skills, which might include:

* How to add, subtract, and re-order readings and experiences.
* How to add admonitions
* How to create problems with "hidden" solutions that can be displayed by toggling.
* How to revise and resubmit your pull request after receiving feedback.

To help you learn how to do these things, you should consult the [Morea Framework Change-HI documentation](https://morea-framework.github.io/docs/category/change-hi). 

Of course, you can always also seek guidance from your faculty sponsor.
