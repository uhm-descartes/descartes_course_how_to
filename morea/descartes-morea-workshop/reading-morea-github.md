# Get ready for the Morea Module

## 1. Sign up with GitHub

For the Morea module, you will be required to fork a GitHub repository, which will require you to have a GitHub account.

It will save you a few minutes of time during the module if you can create your GitHub account prior to the module.

If you do not already have a GitHub account, please go to <https://github.com/join> to register. 

Note that if you register with your hawaii.edu account (either as student or faculty), you will be eligible to apply for [educational benefits](https://education.github.com/).  This includes free access to GitHub Copilot! (Enrollment in the education program is not required for the DESCARTES NRT program.)
